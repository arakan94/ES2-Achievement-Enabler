Say yes when it asks if it can replace files.

To verify that this works, go to Documents/Endless Space 2/Temporary Files, and open the most recent temporary file (after launching a game and loading a mod that disables achievements). Hit Ctrl + F and look for one of these two things:

* `Steam achievements are disabled when using modding tools.` If you see this, you incorrectly installed the mod. Try again.
* `Cobbs has politely told your achievements to stay enabled.` If you see this, you correctly installed the mod. Good job.

To uninstall this, verify the game in your steam library.
