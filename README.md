# ES2-Achievement-Enabler
This mods enables ES2 achievements when using modding tools or mods.

To install this, hit Code > Download ZIP.
Extract the zip into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Endless Space 2\EndlessSpace2_Data\Managed

Say yes when it asks if it can replace files. If it doesn't ask you to replace any files, you have done it incorrectly.

To verify that this works, go to Documents/Endless Space 2/Temporary Files, and open the most recent temporary file (after launching a game and loading a mod that disables achievements). Hit Ctrl + F and look for this:

* `Cobbs has politely told your achievements to stay enabled.` If you see this, you correctly installed the mod. Good job.

To uninstall this, verify the game in your steam library. This will cause no damage to your save games whatsoever.

If you have any problems with getting this to work, feel free to join the [ESG Discord Server](https://discord.gg/eAfNtB3) and try asking for help.

If you can't find help there, and the Achievement Enabler still does not work, try Kuma's mod that does the same thing. You may find it [here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/46302678).
